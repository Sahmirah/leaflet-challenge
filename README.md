# Leaflet Challenge
<br>
For this challenge, I created an interactive map using leaflet, an opensource JavaScript library, to visualize every earthquake that has occured in the past 7 days around the world. I collected the data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and used it to pinpoint all earthquakes based on their latitiude and longitude, depth, and magnitude. I created the data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake and their depth and created popups that provide more details on the exact location it occured.
